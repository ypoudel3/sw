                   <p style="color: white;">Ren uses the device to calculate the route to the hidden planet Exegol in the Unknown Regions. The troubled warrior quickly discovers that the dark and dangerous world is home to the resurrected Palpatine, the Sith, and a massive fleet of Star Destroyers. Palpatine tells Kylo Ren that Rey is not who he thinks she is...</p>

                    <p style="color: white;">Rey runs a training course in the dense jungle of Ajan Kloss. The Jedi student easily leaps, flips, and dodges any obstacle in her way until her strong emotions distract her. BB-8 becomes trapped under a tree as a result of her carelessness.</p>

Their jovial contact Boolio transfers the data just in time, as First Order TIE fighters scream through the atmosphere.</p>

The Jedi-in-training's friends Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO won't let her go alone, and together they set off on a mission to find the hidden planet and face the Emperor one last time.</p>

The black pieces are expertly re-forged with red Sarrassian iron.
